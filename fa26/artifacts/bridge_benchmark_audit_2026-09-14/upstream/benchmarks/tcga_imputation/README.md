# TCGA expression-imputation benchmark

Primary entry point: `tcga_imputation_benchmark.ipynb` (created after the
one-sample validation and full benchmark results are available).

This benchmark compares the frozen 45.6M ExpressionPerformer checkpoint with
the published BulkFormer-50M and BulkFormer-147M checkpoints on the same fixed
1,000 TCGA samples. It contains two analyses:

1. `shared_vocab` (primary): identical evaluable gene symbols and identical
   sample/seed masks across all models.
2. `native_vocab`: each model retains its complete native input vocabulary and
   masks only genes with measured TCGA ground truth.

All models receive their intended natural `log1p(TPM)` representation. Because
the checkpoints use different gene-length resources, MSE is evaluated in each
model's native log-TPM target space and must be interpreted with that provenance;
rank/correlation metrics are less sensitive to this scale difference.

## Gene annotation

The TCGA H5 is a recount2-era matrix whose symbols predate both current HGNC
and parts of the model vocabularies. Preparation therefore resolves the TCGA,
ExpressionPerformer, and BulkFormer labels through the pinned HGNC complete set
at `data/annotations/hgnc/hgnc_complete_set_2026-08-27.tsv`. Resolution uses, in
order, an approved symbol, a unique previous symbol, or a unique alias. Ambiguous
aliases are never guessed. If multiple model nodes resolve to one approved HGNC
symbol, that symbol is excluded from the primary shared-vocabulary benchmark.

The audit artifacts are `results/gene_annotation_summary.csv`,
`results/tcga_hgnc_crosswalk.csv`, and `results/shared_genes.csv`. The exact HGNC
file checksum and mapping-status counts are recorded in
`results/preparation_manifest.json`.

## Layout

```text
tcga_imputation/
├── README.md

`work/` contains frozen sample selection, vocabularies, and prepared matrices.
`results/` contains only benchmark tables and validation provenance.

## Run order

```bash
.venv/bin/pip install -r benchmarks/tcga_imputation/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/tcga_imputation/pipeline/prepare_tcga.py
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/tcga_imputation/pipeline/prepare_frozen_baselines.py
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/tcga_imputation/pipeline/run_imputation.py --validate-one
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/tcga_imputation/pipeline/run_imputation.py --run
```

ARCHS4 strict-unseen human/mouse comparison:

```bash
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/tcga_imputation/pipeline/prepare_archs4_holdout.py
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/tcga_imputation/pipeline/run_archs4_holdout.py \
  --mask-ratios 0.15 0.30 0.50 0.70 0.90 1.00 \
  --mask-seeds 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

These cohorts contain 1,000 samples per species selected from
`sample_manifest.parquet` with `split=unseen`,
`study_exposure=unseen_study`, and `mapping_status=mapped_single`.

The full run is intentionally unavailable until `--validate-one` writes a
successful `results/one_sample_validation.json` for all three checkpoints.

BulkFormer graph resources are the official `G_tcga.pt` and
`G_tcga_weight.pt` files from Zenodo record `15744294`; their expected MD5s are
recorded by the preparation manifest. The adapter preserves the official
notebook's transposed-sparse-adjacency convention when converting these files
to a native PyG edge index (`stored row 1 -> stored row 0`). This orientation
matters because the top-k correlation graph is directed. No fine-tuning occurs.

Gene-wise mean and median baselines are frozen from a deterministic set of
human ARCHS4 **training** samples. They never use TCGA evaluation expression.
Their sample IDs and provenance are saved under `results/`. Legacy transductive
baseline cache files are retained for provenance but excluded from aggregation.
