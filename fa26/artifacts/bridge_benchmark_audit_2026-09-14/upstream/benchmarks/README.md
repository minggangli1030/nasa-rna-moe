# Foundation-model benchmarks

This directory is the index for paper-oriented, reproducible benchmarks. Each
benchmark lives in its own self-contained folder. Start with the linked notebook;
the folder README documents provenance and rerun instructions.

## Benchmark index

| Benchmark | Question | Primary notebook | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paired ARCHS4–recount3 | Are expression and FM embeddings robust to two independent processing pipelines for the same unseen-study samples? | [`paired_recount3/paired_recount3_benchmark.ipynb`](paired_recount3/paired_recount3_benchmark.ipynb) | Complete |
| TCGA expression imputation | How does frozen masked-expression reconstruction compare with BulkFormer-50M and BulkFormer-147M? | [`tcga_imputation/tcga_imputation_benchmark.ipynb`](tcga_imputation/tcga_imputation_benchmark.ipynb) | One-sample validation passed; full run pending |
| Landmark-gene sufficiency | Do L1000 or other fixed reduced gene panels preserve disproportionate information for masked transcriptome reconstruction? | [`landmark_gene_sufficiency/landmark_gene_sufficiency_benchmark.ipynb`](landmark_gene_sufficiency/landmark_gene_sufficiency_benchmark.ipynb) | Reproducible pilot complete |
| Mouse ENCODE | Does tissue identity retrieve across GTEx human and fully unseen ENCODE mouse profiles without alignment? | [`mouse_encode/mouse_encode_benchmark.ipynb`](mouse_encode/mouse_encode_benchmark.ipynb) | Task 1A complete |
| Library-prep disentanglement | Can a frozen BridgeRNA embedding be decomposed into library-invariant and library-associated representations? | [`library_prep_disentanglement/library_prep_disentanglement_benchmark.ipynb`](library_prep_disentanglement/library_prep_disentanglement_benchmark.ipynb) | Data audit and controlled-pair pipeline |

## Folder convention

Every new benchmark should use:

```text
benchmarks/
├── README.md                         # this index
└── <benchmark_name>/
    ├── <benchmark_name>_benchmark.ipynb  # primary human-readable analysis
    ├── README.md                         # design, inputs, and reproduction
    ├── config.json                       # frozen benchmark parameters, if needed
    ├── pipeline/                         # upstream preparation code
    ├── results/                          # final tables and figures
    └── work/                             # ignored intermediates and caches
```

Use one folder per scientific question—not one folder per dataset. For example,
a GTEx/TCGA/ARCHS4 comparison belongs in one cross-dataset benchmark folder if
all three datasets answer the same question. The notebook should be the obvious
entry point and should state which files are final results versus restart caches.

Reusable cohort selection, embedding access, preprocessing, and metrics belong
in `src/fm_embed/`; benchmark folders should contain only benchmark-specific
orchestration and reporting.
